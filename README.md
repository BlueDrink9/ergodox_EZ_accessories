# Ergodox EZ 3d accessories for 3d printing

Of general use might be the `ergodox_ez_outline.scad`, which contains a bunch of variables and an outline of the base of the Ergodox-EZ that other users may wish to import in order to get the measurements right for their own projects.
Not guaranteed to be 100% accurate, but were measured from a semi-official Ergodox-EZ 3D model so should be pretty close. For all of my prints I have found them to be spot on.

Examples of the main meshes of interest can be previewed on Github by clicking on them. (In the exported meshes folder - no guarantee they are the latest version, only included for easy previewing).

There is also a slice folder with my Cura slicing settings. Choices made may be for esoteric reasons like speed, so use as a guide at best.

## Accessories

### Vertical bracket mount

Designed to slide onto an L bracket, allowing the keyboard to be used with your arms hanging fully vertically down (most useful when standing).
Example images to come later, once prototyping is complete.

### Upright bracket

A less radical design, intended to enable extreme tilting of 60ยบ+.
Redesign of https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3207945 and https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2748084.
My redesign is more customisable (you can change the angle, wall and base thicknesses, wall height), which also gives it much-needed strength compared to the other designs.

Intended to be held on the desk or armrest with some variant of [this clamp](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3075868), although the sockets for the clamp can be disabled with a parameter.

Again, photo examples are on their way.
